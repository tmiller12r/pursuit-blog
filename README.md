# Blog API

You are to build a simple, authentication enabled Blog API. This API will contain the following high level functionalities:

* CRUD options for a User
* CRUD options for a Post, linked to a User
* CRUD options for a Comment, linked to both a User (the author) and a Post (the comment container)

All posts and comments should be publicly readable ONLY. Additionally, any user's details can be publicly accessed (save the email / password).

A user can be created publicly but only an authenticated user can update her/his profile via PUT or DELETE.

A post can only be created, deleted or updated by an authenticated user that is author of post.
A comment can only be created, deleted or updated by an authenticated user that is author of comment OR the author of the post.

# Routes
